We will have the user guess correct color in order. 
We will creat a list that will include four colors.
We'll begin by creating an empty list and ask the user to guess the first color.
Then we use the append funtion to add the users guess color to the list.
The user will make four color guess and that would be stored in the list.
We will then compare the users guess list to the correct answer list.
If the user is not able to guess correct in 20 tries, he will loss.
If he guesses it within the 20 tries, he wins, and breaks out of the funtion.
If the color in the user's list is the same color and in same order as the correct list, then the user wins breaks out of the funtion.
If the user does not guess correct in the first try, the funtion continues and the user can guess again
